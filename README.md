# DTMF Tone Generation and Recognition

## Project Overview

In this project, we worked with **DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) tones**, the sounds generated by a telephone keypad.  
The workflow included **generating tones, analyzing their frequency spectrum, and recognizing the dialed number**.  

We used two approaches to detect the numbers from frequency data: **manual recognition** and **automatic recognition**.

## Methodology

### 1. Tone Generation
- Generated audio for a telephone keypad tone corresponding to a specific number.  
- Analyzed its **frequency spectrum** using Fourier Transform to verify the correct frequencies.

### 2. Manual Number Recognition
- Using frequency datasets, manually matched the peak frequencies in the spectrum to corresponding numbers.  

### 3. Automatic Number Recognition
- Two datasets containing frequency values for different samples were used.  
- The algorithm works as follows:
  1. For each target digit, subtract its frequency spectrum from the spectra of all possible numbers.  
  2. Take the **absolute value** of the differences.  
  3. The number corresponding to the **minimum value** is identified as the dialed number.  

This automatic approach efficiently finds the dialed number by comparing frequency patterns.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- `numpy` for numerical computations  
- `scipy` or `librosa` for audio processing  
- `matplotlib` for visualizing frequency spectra  

## Workflow Summary

1. Generate DTMF tone for a number  
2. Analyze its frequency spectrum  
3. Compare with frequency datasets  
4. Recognize the number manually  
5. Recognize the number automatically using minimum difference approach
